        <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. <br>Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. <br>It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. <br>It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of <a href="https://www.lipsum.com/" target="_blank"> Lorem Ipsum.</a> </p>
